1. Web Framework: Flask is used for the backend, and the frontend is designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
2. Database: MySQL is employed to store user data, course details, and interaction history.
3. Python Libraries : Libraries such as smtplib, Flask modules, pandas are used.

# Requirements


1. Python 3.x: The application is written in Python, so a compatible version of Python should be installed.
2. Dependencies: Install the required Python libraries by running pip install -r requirements.txt. Ensure that the requirements.txt file contains all the necessary dependencies for the project.
3. MySQL Database: Set up a MySQL database and configure the connection details in the application.
